<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I chose to take this course because I wanted to learn this basic skill, because last school year for a computer maintenance class I wanted to make a website for my project, but I didn't know how to accually properly do it. With this class I am hoping to learn more about the in's and out's of how a website works and then be able to expand on that knowledge more in college or just on my own trying to learn more and more about the intricacies of computers. I also took this course because at the same time as this course I am taking an "Intro to Programming" course and I thought that the two courses would work hand and hand and maybe be able to give me more insight on how to go above and beyond the expectations of one course or the other. On top of what I have already mentioned, I think one of the biggest reasons I decided to take this course was just to get more involved with computers and just keep exploring more and more different aspects of them to see what I would like to do as a profession and major in in college (plus I figured it would be a lot of fun.)</p>
